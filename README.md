## üìå Problem Statement

The PMGSY program has multiple sub-schemes (e.g., PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA), each with distinct funding rules and implementation criteria. Manually classifying thousands of road and bridge projects is time-consuming and error-prone.

The goal of this project is to build a **multi-class classification model** that can automatically predict the correct **PMGSY_SCHEME** based on physical and financial project characteristics.
